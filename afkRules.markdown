# AFK Rules
Players who are away for an extended period of time in games can be **temporarily kicked** from the game and AI takes over.

A player is considered to be AFK if:

1. The player has not been online for X number of days - See the `AFK Last Seen Limit` game setting.
2. In **turn based** games, the player has reached the maximum number of missed turns. - See the `AFK Missed Turn Limit` game setting.
3. The player has not been online for X number of cycles - See the `AFK Galactic Cycle Limit` game setting.

## AFK Slots
A player who has been kicked for being AFK can **rejoin** their own slot at any time, providing it has not been filled by another player.

If a player goes AFK, you can **fill the AFK slot** (as long as you aren't already playing). At the end of the game, **extra rank is awarded** at `1.5x` normal rank (minimum of 0 rank points). See [Rankings](./rankings.markdown) for more details.

## AFK vs. Conceded Defeat
There is a key difference between a player who has **conceded defeat** and a player who has been kicked for being AFK, a player who has conceded has purposefully resigned from the game.

Slots for players who have conceded defeat **cannot be filled** by other players wishing to join the game, only AFK slots can be filled.

## AI Takeover
If a player has not been seen for **12 hours** after the game has started, the AI will take over their slot. The slot is reserved for that player until the player actually goes AFK (the slot opens) or the player returns before the AFK timeout.

Players who are AI controlled will have a little robot icon on their player profile.
