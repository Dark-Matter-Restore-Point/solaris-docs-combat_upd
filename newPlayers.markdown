# New Players

It is recommended to complete a **New Player Game** or the **Tutorial** before proceeding to the other **Official** game modes.

You can find the new player game by navigating from the Main Menu to **Join Game -> New Players**. You will likely be faced up against players who are also new and are just starting up.

*Note: New Player Games do not affect Rank or Victories.*

## Tips For Beginners

1. Complete the tutorial - The tutorial is a great place to start and should give you the basics on how to play.
2. Read the Wiki - The Wiki aims to be a complete guide on everything about the game.
3. Talk to players - Whether this is in game or in community channels, learn from experienced players to get a head start.
4. Don't take the game too seriously and have fun.
