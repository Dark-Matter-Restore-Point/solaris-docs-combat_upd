# Specialists

If a star or carrier has a specialist, the matching specialist icon will be displayed instead of the standard star/carrier icon. 

Specialists can provide any number of modifiers to a star or carrier's statistics, and are fundamental to a strategically successful game.

By default, specialists require specialist tokens. You can change this setting to make specialists require credits instead.

### Specialist Monthly Bans

In **official games**, 3 specialists are banned from each pool (star and carrier), this resets on the 1st of every month. Check the game settings before joining an official game to see which specialists are banned and adapt your strategy and tactical play to gain an edge.
