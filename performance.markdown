# Performance

If you are finding that the game lags or consumes a lot of battery (for mobile devices) you can tweak the graphics settings to improve performance.

Go to the main menu and click on your name at the top left of the screen, this will take you to the settings page where you can tweak the following settings:

- **Territory Style** - `Disable` or alter the settings for your chosen territory style.
- **Natural Resources** - Switch to `Single Ring`.
- **Background Nebula** - Decrease the sliders for `Frequency` and `Density`.
- **Moving Nebulas** - Switch to `Disabled`.
- **Anti Aliasing** - Switch to `Disabled`.
- **Carrier Loop Style** - Switch to `Solid`.

*Try adjusting the following settings one by one until the performance is satisfactory.*
