# Community Guidelines

- Treat others online as you would treat them in real life
- Be tolerant towards otherâ€™s viewpoints; respectfully disagree when opinions do not align
- Respect the privacy and personal information of other members
- Communicate with courtesy and respect

Please do not:

- Make personal attacks on other community members
- Use defamatory remarks or make false statements against others
- Post prejudiced comments or profanity
- Bully or make inflammatory remarks to other community members
- Use alt accounts/multiboxing to cheat in games.

We will take action when we see someone violating these guidelines. Sometimes that just means giving someone a warning; other times it means revoking certain privileges or accounts entirely. We request that all community members report behavior that violates our guidelines to the **Project Owner** or the **Community Managers**.
