## Spectating Games
If spectating is **enabled** (see game settings), players can invite other users who are not playing in the game to spectate from their perspective.

1. In game, open the Menu -> Spectators.
2. Type in the username of the user you want to invite and click "Invite"
3. The user will be added to your spectator list.

The user will then be able to see your game listed on their games list page and view the galaxy from your perspective, they will be able to see what you can see within your scanning range.

*Note: Users can be invited to spectate multiple players to see more of the galaxy. This is particularly useful for 1v1s.*
